(SIGN) Southern Independent Games Network

SIGN is a not-for-profit network, established to represent and support independent 
video games developers and facilitate the growth of the independent video games 
development sector in the Southern region of the UK. The network is focused 
primarily on providing support in areas associated with business aspects of 
the video games industry, for example, in areas such as funding, tax, marketing 
and law. The support will be provided through a series of events, web-based 
resources and through facilitating connections between members of the network and 
professionals within, and complementary to, the video games industry. Our members 
include independent games developers, university academics, researchers, students 
and technology businesses.
